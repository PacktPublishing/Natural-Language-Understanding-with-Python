## What is this book about?

Natural Language Understanding facilitates the organization and structuring of language allowing computer systems to effectively process textual information for various practical applications. Natural Language Understanding with Python will help you explore practical techniques for harnessing NLU to create diverse applications.

Complete with step-by-step explanations of essential concepts and practical examples, you’ll begin by learning about NLU and its applications. You’ll then explore a wide range of current NLU techniques and their most appropriate use-case. In the process, you’ll be introduced to the most useful Python NLU libraries. Not only will you learn the basics of NLU, you’ll also discover practical issues such as acquiring data, evaluating systems, and deploying NLU applications along with their solutions. The book is a comprehensive guide that’ll help you explore techniques and resources that can be used for different applications in the future.

By the end of this book, you’ll be well-versed with the concepts of natural language understanding, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs) for building various AI-based applications.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Explore the uses and applications of different NLP techniques
* Understand practical data acquisition and system evaluation workflows
* Build cutting-edge and practical NLP applications to solve problems
* Master NLP development from selecting an application to deployment
* Optimize NLP application maintenance after deployment
* Build a strong foundation in neural networks and deep learning for NLU
